Android (Flutter) Integration - Overview

Option A (Edge): Convert the YOLO model to TFLite and run inference on-device.

Option B (Server): Run the Python detection service (a REST API) on a server. The Android app uploads video or sends frames; server returns counts and annotated frames.

Minimal server sketch:
- Flask API: /upload (POST) accepts video, runs detect_and_count.py, returns JSON counts and optionally annotated video URL

Flutter side:
- File picker to choose video
- Upload to server (multipart/form-data)
- Show progress and display results

Security: Protect your server and API (auth tokens), and if using OpenAI API keys keep them only on server side.
